# School Grading System

## Overview

This Python-based School Grading System helps in calculating and managing the grades of students in a school. The system allows teachers to input student marks, calculate final grades based on predetermined rules, and generate reports for each student. It can be used to automate the grading process and make the management of student results more efficient.

## Features

- Input student names and their respective marks for various subjects.
- Calculate grades based on predefined rules.
- Display a student's final grade.
- Handle different types of grading scales (e.g., percentage-based, letter grades).
- Generate reports for all students.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Libraries:
  - `matplotlib` (optional, for graphical representation)
  - `pandas` (optional, for managing data tables)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository or download the files:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/school-grading-system.git
   ```
   
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd school-grading-system
   ```

3. Install required dependencies (if any):
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. Launch the Python script `grading_system.py` to start the program:
   ```bash
   python grading_system.py
   ```

2. Follow the on-screen prompts to enter student data:
   - Name of the student
   - Marks for each subject
   - Grading scale (percentage or letter grades)
   
3. The system will calculate and display the student's final grade based on the provided rules.

## Example

### Input:
```plaintext
Enter student name: John Doe
Enter marks for Mathematics: 85
Enter marks for English: 78
Enter marks for Science: 92
Enter marks for History: 88
```

### Output:
```plaintext
Student: John Doe
Mathematics: 85
English: 78
Science: 92
History: 88

Final Grade: B+ (Percentage: 85%)
```

## Grading Scale (Default)

- 90% and above: A
- 80% to 89%: B+
- 70% to 79%: B
- 60% to 69%: C+
- 50% to 59%: C
- Below 50%: F

## Code Structure

- `grading_system.py`: The main script to input marks and calculate grades.
- `utils.py`: Utility functions for calculating averages, generating letter grades, etc.
- `student_data.json` (optional): A JSON file to store student grades for persistent data management.
- `requirements.txt`: A list of Python libraries required to run the project (if needed).
